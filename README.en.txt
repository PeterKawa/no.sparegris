Save money by moving power consumption

This app has been created to handle energy pricing with the following variables:
* Power tariff based on max power from last month
* Electricity prices per hour

Instructions:
- Install the app
- Go to Apps / Piggy Bank / Configure app
- Select devices that the app should control
- Set Mode to Normal
- Go to the "Normal" tab
  - Select target value for power tariff
  - Select device priorities
- Click save
- Save over 1000 NOK a year on the power tariff. (in Norway)
- Experiment with the settings and flows and follow the recomendations below to get the most out of the app.

Important:
- All devices controlled by the app should not be switched on by other flows, otherwise conflicts will arise and the target value for the power tariff may fail.
- In case a flow informs the app about the current price point then the temperature should not be changed by other sources too.
- Other things such as brightness, max wattage etc. can be controlled outside the app.

Recommendations:
- Use flows to change between normal / night mode at relevant times.
- Use flows to inform the app when the energy price is expensive / cheap.
- Configure the temperature settings for different modes and price points for optimal heating control.
- Use flows to turn off zones when a room is ventilated.
- Use flows to increase reserved power consumption at the start of the hour you normally cook dinner.
- Use flows to reduce reserved power consumption when you have normally finished making dinner.
- Use flows to ensure that you are notified when the app has detected a large uncontrollable power consumption before the end of the hour, which you must manually stop to meet the power tariff.
