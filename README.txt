The main goal of this app is to limit the maximum electricity consumption per hour so that you stay within the desired power tariff in Norway and elsewhere where applicable. Electricity consumption will also be moved from expensive to cheap hours where possible.
Please note that the app is still under development so it would be appreciated if any errors are reported in the forum so that they can be fixed as soon as possible.

Instructions:
- Install the app
- Go to Apps / Piggy Bank / Configure app
- Under the "Devices->Controllable Devices" tab:
   - Select the devices you want the app to control. The more power that can be controlled the better.
- Under the "Home" tab:
   - Select target value for power tariff
   - Activate the app
- Click save
- Add a flow card to send the current power from the power-meter to this app
- Save over 1000 NOK a year on the power tariff. (in Norway)
- Experiment with the settings and flows and follow the recommendations below to get the most out of the app.
- Install the piggy bank insights device if you're interested in statistics (this is optional)

Recommendations:
- Set up flow cards to change between modes day/night/etc. at relevant times.
- Turn on price management to move electricity between expensive and cheap hours (under "Devices->Price management")
- Set up temperature settings for different modes and price points for optimal heat management (under "Devices->Modes and priority")
- Use flows to turn off zones when a room is ventilated.
- Use flows to increase reserved power consumption at the start of the hour you normally cook dinner.
- Use flows to reduce reserved power consumption when you have normally finished making dinner.
- Use flows to switch off relevant zones when you ventilate or there is strong sunshine.
- Use flows to ensure that you are notified when the app has detected a large uncontrollable power consumption before the end of the hour, which you must manually stop to meet the power tariff.
