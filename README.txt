Save money by moving power consumption

This app has been created to handle energy pricing with the following variables:
* Power tariff based on max power from last month
* Electricity prices per hour

Instructions:
- Install the app
- Go to Apps / Piggy Bank / Configure app
- Select devices that the app should control
- Set Mode to Normal
- Go to the "Normal" tab
  - Select target value for power tariff
  - Select device priorities
- Save
- Save over 1000 NOK a year on the power tariff. (in Norway)

Important:
- All devices controlled by the app must not be switched on by other flows, otherwise conflicts will arise and the target value for the power tariff may fail.
- Other things such as temperature, brightness, max wattage etc. can be controlled outside the app.

Recommendations:
- Use flows to change between normal / night mode at relevant times.
- Use flows to increase reserved power consumption at the start of the hour you normally cook dinner.
- Use flows to reduce reserved power consumption when you have normally finished making dinner.
- Use flows to ensure that you are notified when the app has detected a large power consumption before the end of the hour, which you must manually stop to meet the power tariff.

If successfull the app will save you significant amount of money over time.
