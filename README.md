Save money by controling when to use electricity

TODO list:
* Remove public API for refreshing devices. Use settings instead.
* Find out if the public-variable for API's can be used to expose an api to the h√∏iax app.
* Use the devices default setpoint temperatures when creating the device list for the first time. Water heaters get way too low temp as default.
* Add number of cheap/expensive/normal hours to the device display
* Add calculation of what is best, higher tariff or money saved by moving electricity between price points
